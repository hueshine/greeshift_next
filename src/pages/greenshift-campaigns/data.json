Plastics have entered the forests and rivers and our natural environment impacting biodiversity. Thus, there is a great need to create awareness about this ever-growing issue of plastic pollution.&nbsp; </p> <p> Photography serves as a transformative tool, offering unique perspectives through various lenses and enabling diverse narratives to emerge. It holds the remarkable ability to persuade and shed light on pressing issues, compelling viewers to take action in preserving our environment.&nbsp; </p> <p> With the launch of the GreenShift campaign, this photography competition sets out to provide a dynamic platform for the youth across Nepal to engage with environmental concerns and celebrate the beauty of our natural world while also highlighting emerging challenges.
