    "description": "<p>In Nepal, waste entrepreneurs and waste workers (WWs) are at the center of the plastic waste management process. They are involved at every step from collecting waste from segregation to recycling of the products. However, they are also some of the most marginalized communities in Nepal. Furthermore, due to the lack of a formal alliance between the WWs, there is no information shared among them with no dialogue being held between them and their employers, the private sector, and municipalities.</p> <p>GreenShift Nepal intends to bridge this gap by forming and strengthening the civil society organizations of WWs, which will help in the socio-economic upliftment by ensuring their human rights, labor rights, social security rights, and financial freedom. Similarly, the CSOs of WWs will be the champions/leaders of recycling and circular economy through effectively advocating for plastic recycling and solid waste management policies at local, provincial, and federal levels.</p>",
